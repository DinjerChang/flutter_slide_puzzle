# The Pharaoh's Bedroom

This app is a new Flutter puzzle game for Google Flutter Puzzle Hack. Our Team designed pages and developed puzzle game in Dart.

## Description

As you wake up, you find that you have passed through to the ancient Eygpt and transformed into a pharaoh. At that time, you are not sure this is a dream or a reality. In the dark, you can feel the magic filling over in this Pharaoh's room. "You have been cursed... .", the old and scary sound suddenly came over and said, " if you want to escape this cursed room, you need to find a pair of golden slippers and wear on them to eliminate the dark magic or you will get stuck here forever."
To follow that hint, you're starting to explore this Pharaoh's room step and step... The only way you can survive is to slide your step and avoid bumping the cursed stuff and find the golden slipper. Let's see what's your destiny in the end!
